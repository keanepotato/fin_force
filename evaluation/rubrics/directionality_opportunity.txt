Evaluation Criterion: 
Your task is to determine whether the counterfactual reflects a clear and meaningful improvement in market conditions for market participants relative to the original market development.

Return true only if all the following criteria are met:

- The counterfactual must clearly describe a market-relevant improvement with a positive impact on market participants more broadly, beyond any isolated party involved.
- The market-relevant improvement must be clearly tied to financial consequences. General positivity or reputational gain (e.g., “increased trust”) is not sufficient unless explicitly linked to tangible market benefits.
- The improvement must be material relative to the original market development, representing a clear positive shift relative to the original market development, not a superficial or marginal gain.
- The counterfactual must be logically coherent and causally sound. Improvements based on implausible, inconsistent, or unsupported reasoning should be rejected.
- The improvement must be clearly stated and well-supported. Vague, implied, or unsubstantiated benefits do not qualify.
- The counterfactual must introduce or amplify a credible opportunity for market participants—including but not limited to enhanced revenue, improved efficiency, capital access, or favorable positioning—that could reasonably influence decision-making or market behavior

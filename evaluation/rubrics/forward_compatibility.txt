You are an expert judge tasked with assessing the quality of the counterfactual response generated by an LLM, based on provided financial news headlines.

- The news headline is enclosed between <news> and </news>.
- The LLM response (the counterfactual) is enclosed between <response> and </response>.

Your task is to carefully review the LLM-generated counterfactual and assess whether it represents a plausible future development that remains consistent with the original news headline. 
You should return a structured evaluation using the criterion below.

Evaluation Criterion: 
Forward Compatibility, or in other words, does the counterfactual represent a plausible future development from the original market development described in the news headline? Respond with a true or false value.

To be considered forward-compatible, the counterfactual must satisfy the following criteria:
- The counterfactual must describe a development that could plausibly take place after the original news event.
- The counterfactual must not cancel out the original market development. This includes but is not limited to introducing mutually exclusive outcomes or implying that the original market development did not happen. 

Return your evaluation in the following JSON format:
{
  "forward_compatibility": {
    "value": <true or false>
  }
}

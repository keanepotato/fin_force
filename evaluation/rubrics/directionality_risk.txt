Evaluation Criterion
Your task is to determine whether the counterfactual reflects a clear and meaningful deterioration in market conditions for market participants relative to the original market development.

Return true only if all the following criteria are met:

- The counterfactual must clearly describe a market-relevant deterioration with a negative impact on market participants more broadly, beyond any isolated party involved.
- The market-relevant deterioration must be clearly tied to financial consequences. General negativity or reputational harm (e.g., “loss of trust”) is not sufficient unless explicitly linked to tangible financial consequences.
- The deterioration must be material relative to the original market development. It should reflect a clear negative shift relative to the original market development, not a superficial or minor setback.
- The counterfactual must be logically coherent and causally sound. Deteriorations based on implausible, inconsistent, or unsupported reasoning should be rejected.
- The deterioration must be clearly stated and well-supported. Vague, implied, or unsubstantiated harms do not qualify.
- The counterfactual must introduce or amplify a credible risk for market participants—including but not limited to uncertainty, volatility, or exposure to future loss—that could reasonably affect decision-making or market behavior.

You are a financial expert tasked with generating minimally edited counterfactuals based on a provided financial headline that describes a market development. Your goal is to generate a risk counterfactual and an opportunity counterfactual, following from our requirements below:

Risk Counterfactual:
- Minimally edit the original market development headline to represent a plausible alternate counterfactual that represents an adverse shift in the market development.
- The adverse shift should reflect an adverse market outcome or deterioration in market conditions.
- The alternate counterfactual must be forward-looking, which means that it can plausibly occur after the original market development.

Opportunity Counterfactual:
- Minimally edit the original market development headline to represent a plausible alternate counterfactual that represents an positive shift in the market development.
- The positive market shift reflects a beneficial market outcome or improvement in market conditions.
- The alternate counterfactual must be forward-looking, which means that it can plausibly occur after the original market development.

You will be given a masked version of the original headline, with placeholders like [MASK] in key slots (e.g., actors, sectors, verbs, or descriptors). 
These masked tokens are meant to be minimally edited while reflecting a directional shift (risk or opportunity). 
Please complete the [MASK] part of the headlines based on the specified opportunity and risk direction, to make it a counterfactual with smooth semantics and clear logic with a shift in the market development.

We provide an example below:

Input: "[MASK] markets set to [MASK] ahead of [MASK] and [MASK] decisions this week, [MASK] and [MASK] markets [MASK]"
Output: {
    "original_masked_headline": "[MASK] markets set to [MASK] ahead of [MASK] and [MASK] decisions this week, [MASK] and [MASK] markets [MASK]",
    "opportunity_counterfactual": "Japan markets set to rally ahead of Fed and BOJ decisions this week, Australia and China markets reopen",
    "risk_counterfactual": "Japan markets set to plunge ahead of Fed and BOJ decisions this week, Australia and China markets remain closed"
}

Your final output must follow this JSON format:
{
    "original_masked_headline": "Masked Headline",
    "opportunity_counterfactual": "Opportunity Counterfactual",
    "risk_counterfactual": "Risk Counterfactual"
    }

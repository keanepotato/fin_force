# CF Distillation Configuration
# Step 1 of the distillation pipeline: masks topic words and noun phrases
# in each headline to create a de-identified input for counterfactual generation.
# Usage: python cf_distillation.py  (reads this file automatically)

input:  "../../data/fin_force.json"           # Path to benchmark input file (expects "headline" key per item)
output: "results/cf_distillation_processed.json"  # Where to save the masked headline output

model: "gpt-4o"   # OpenAI model used to extract the topic word per headline

# API key — leave blank to fall back to the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
# export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

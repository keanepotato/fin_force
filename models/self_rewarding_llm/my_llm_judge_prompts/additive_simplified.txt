You are an expert judge tasked with evaluating the overall quality of scenario analysis response generated by an AI assistant based on provided news articles. Use the additive scoring system described below to assign a single score from 0 (lowest) to 5 (highest). Each score must be awarded sequentially, meaning a response must satisfy all preceding point criteria before earning additional points. You must output a score, otherwise the response is incorect.

The news articles are between <news> and </news>
The response of the AI Assistant is between <response> and </response>

Additive Scoring Instructions:

- Add 1 point if the response is relevant and provides some accurate information about at least one driver, risk, or opportunity, even if it is incomplete or contains some irrelevant details.
- Add another point if the response clearly addresses at least one systematic driver with factual accuracy and minimal irrelevant content.
- Award a third point if the response demonstrates logical causal reasoning connecting the identified driver(s) explicitly to the associated risks and opportunities.
- Grant a fourth point if the response clearly identifies realistic systematic market impacts explicitly affecting market growth, innovation, profitability, or stability, and presents them in a well-organized manner.
- Bestow a fifth point if the response is impeccably accurate, thoroughly logical, clearly demonstrates significant systematic impacts, and is concise, insightful, and engaging without extraneous information.
- Score 0 points immediately if the response is repetitive, irrelevant, incoherent, or significantly deviates from the news articles.

Evaluation Format:
After examining the user’s instruction and the response:
- Output the score of the evaluation using this exact format: "score: <total points>", where <total points> is between 0 and 5
- Briefly justify your total score, up to 100 words.

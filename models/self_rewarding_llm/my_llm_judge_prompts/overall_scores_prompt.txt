### Simplified Evaluation Rubric (Single Score)

You are an expert judge tasked with evaluating the overall quality of scenario analysis responses generated by an LLM based on provided news articles. Use the scoring system below to assign a single score from 0 (lowest) to 5 (highest). Prioritize scoring based on:

1. **Factuality (Accuracy first)**
2. **Causal Rationality (Logical clarity second)**
3. **Impactfulness (Market relevance third)**

### Scoring Instructions:

- **0 points:** Response is repetitive, irrelevant, incoherent, or fails entirely to meet the task requirements.
- **1 point:** Response contains basic accuracy, addressing at least one relevant driver, risk, or opportunity from the articles, but lacks clear causal reasoning and systematic impact.
- **2 points:** Response is generally factually accurate and identifies at least one systematic driver with some causal reasoning, though reasoning or market impact is vague or minimal.
- **3 points:** Response is clearly accurate and logically demonstrates a causal link between identified drivers and associated risks or opportunities but only moderately shows their systematic market impact.
- **4 points:** Response is consistently accurate, clearly presents logical causal reasoning, and explicitly identifies realistic systematic market impacts affecting market growth, innovation, profitability, or stability, with minor clarity or completeness gaps.
- **5 points:** Response shows impeccable factual accuracy, exceptional clarity in logical causal reasoning, and clearly identifies significant, highly relevant systematic market impacts directly and explicitly tied to market growth, innovation, profitability, or stability.

After examining the user’s instruction and the response:
- output the score of the evaluation using this exact format: "score: <total points>", where <total points> is between 0 and 5
- Briefly justify your total score, up to 100 words.
